## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+ installed
- HaveIBeenPwned API key (get one at https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key)
- OpenAI API key (get one at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checksafe.git
cd checksafe
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API keys:
```

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> **Note:** The app uses OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini` model by default. To use a different model, edit `server/lib/openai.ts` and change the `model` parameter.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

CheckSafe is provided for educational and informational purposes. While we strive for accuracy:
- Breach data comes from third-party sources (HaveIBeenPwned)
- AI detection is probabilistic, not definitive
- Always verify critical security decisions with multiple sources
- OpenAI API calls may be slow for longer text inputs (20-30 seconds typical); consider using shorter excerpts
