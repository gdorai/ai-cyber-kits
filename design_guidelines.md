## Page Structure

### Hero Section (50vh)
- Split layout: Left 60% (content), Right 40% (visual)
- **Image**: Abstract geometric pattern with circuit board elements overlaid with translucent security icons (shield, lock, checkmark) - conveys tech sophistication and protection
- Headline emphasizing "Everyday" + "Free" + "Instant"
- Subheading explaining the four tools
- Primary CTA: "Try Tools Below" (scroll anchor)
- Trust indicators strip: "100% Private â€¢ No Data Stored â€¢ Open Source"

### Tools Grid Section
- 2x2 grid on desktop (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2), gap-8
- Each tool card is interactive preview:
  - Icon (use Heroicons)
  - Tool name + one-line description
  - Mini input preview (non-functional teaser)
  - "Try Tool" button â†’ expands into full tool interface
- Visual hierarchy: Cards have subtle elevation (shadow-lg), hover state lifts (translate-y)

### Individual Tool Interfaces
**Consistent Pattern for All Four:**
1. **Input Section**: 
   - Large textarea or input field with clear placeholder
   - Supporting text explaining what to input
   - "Analyze" or "Check" primary button
   
2. **Results Section** (appears after analysis):
   - Risk meter/score visualization (horizontal bar with color gradient)
   - Breakdown cards showing specific findings
   - Explainability annotations (your research twist)
   - Action recommendations (bullet list with checkmarks)

3. **Educational Context**:
   - Collapsible "How This Works" section
   - Links to related resources

### Features Section (3-column grid)
- Column 1: "ðŸ”’ Privacy First" - No data stored, all processing local/ephemeral
- Column 2: "ðŸ§  AI-Powered" - Research-backed detection algorithms
- Column 3: "ðŸ“– Educational" - Learn while you check

### Footer
- Links: About, Contact, Documentation, GitHub
- Newsletter signup: "Stay safe - get monthly security tips"
- Affiliation: University/Lab credit with logo

## Images
1. **Hero Image** (Right side, 40% width): Abstract geometric security visualization with soft blue gradients, circuit patterns, and floating shield/lock icons. Should feel modern and trustworthy, not intimidating.

2. **Feature Icons**: Use Heroicons throughout (shield-check, document-magnifying-glass, sparkles, light-bulb)

## Animations
**Minimal & Purposeful Only:**
- Risk meter fill animation (once on mount)
- Card hover lift (subtle 2px translate-y)
- Results fade-in (opacity transition)
- NO: Parallax, complex scroll animations, floating elements
