Perfect — those four tools really complement your profile while being **highly usable for everyday people**. Let’s flesh them out into **strong, polished ideas** you could develop as a mini “Cyber Safety + AI Awareness Hub.”

## 🌐 Concept: **Everyday Digital Safety & AI Checkpoint**

A lightweight, modern website offering free, browser-based tools that blend **cybersecurity hygiene** + **AI explainability.**

### 1. **Email/Domain Breach Lookup**

* **Backend:** Use [HaveIBeenPwned API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3).
* **UI:** Clean input box → “Check if your email/domain is in a breach.”
* **Result:** Show breach sources + friendly tips (“Change password,” “Enable 2FA”).
* **Value Add (your twist):** Include a **risk score meter** (color-coded bar) to make it visually intuitive.

---

### 2. **Phishing Email Analyzer**

* **Input:** Paste suspicious email text OR upload `.eml`.
* **Output:**

  * Highlights dangerous patterns: urgent language (“Act now!”), financial requests, suspicious links.
  * Gives a simple “Phish Risk Meter” (Low/Medium/High).
* **Your edge:** Wrap it with an **Explainable AI style breakdown** — show why the system flagged a phrase → builds trust + matches your research expertise.

---

### 3. **AI Text Detector**

* **Input:** Paste text → Detects whether it looks AI-generated.
* **Output:** Probability score (e.g., “70% likely AI-generated”).
* **Approach:** You could start with open-source detectors (like OpenAI’s classifiers, GPTZero-style, or simple perplexity-based models).
* **Your twist:** Add a **confidence + context explanation** (“Repetitive phrasing and low lexical diversity flagged this as AI”).

---

### 4. **Bias Spotlight**

* **Input:** Paste text (news, email, article, job description).
* **Output:** Highlights:

  * Loaded/emotional language (“shocking, unbelievable, huge”).
  * Gender/racial bias indicators.
  * Subjectivity vs objectivity.
* **Your edge:** Use lightweight NLP models (spaCy, HuggingFace transformers) + **forensic-style annotation** (like your CADENCE explainability work).

## 🔑 Why This Combo is Strong

* **Approachable:** These tools are instantly useful for non-tech users.
* **Aligned with your expertise:** Digital forensics + explainable AI → credibility and academic tie-in.
* **Scalable:** You can start with simple rule-based/NLP methods, then upgrade with your lab’s AI research.
* **Brandable:** Could become *“CheckSafe.ai”* or *“Everyday Cyber Forensics.”*

👉 Next step could be designing a **homepage layout** with these 4 tools as quick-access tiles (like your stopwatch idea).
Do you want me to **sketch a sample homepage flow** (sections, tool cards, minimal UI idea), or do you want me to **prioritize which one to build first** for fastest impact?
